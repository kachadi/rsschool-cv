### 2. Profile:
Iâ€™m a junior front-end developer. By education I am a cartographer. After graduating from university, I worked as a CG artist in a design and architecture studio. Therefore, I have good skills in working with graphic editors and with the creation of computer-generated images. Later, I worked for an international IT company that specializes in creating mapping tools, develops navigation applications and updates maps around the world. There I was engaged in projects related to neural network training, mapping and routing analysis. Here I also learned teamwork and how to build my workflow as efficiently as possible while working remotely. I have always been interested in learning and It seems to me that I can do it quickly and efficiently. Now I am ready for new challenges and opportunities. Therefore, I decided to explore a new direction and develop in it.
